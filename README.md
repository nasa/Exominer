## Introduction

This project's mission is to develop, test, and deploy automated machine learning-based methods to sift ('mine') through 
transit photometry data from exoplanet survey missions such as Kepler and TESS and inform subject matter experts (SMEs) 
on potential transiting planet candidates.

![ExoMiner High-level Representation](/others/images/exominer_high_level_prediction.png)
ExoMiner is trained to classify a given TCE example as an **exoplanet** or a **non-planet** (i.e., false positive such 
as eclipsing binary, background objects, instrumental noise like momentum dumps) based on its prediction score between 
zero and one and a classification threshold value.

### Current main goals

The main goals of the `ExoMiner` pipeline are:

1. Perform classification of transit signals for TESS (2-min cadence and FFI).
2. Create vetting catalogs based on results produced for TESS SPOC Threshold Crossing Events (TCEs).
3. Validate new exoplanets from TESS.

## Data

All data used in this project are publicly available. Generally, the data used consist of:

- TCE and Objects of Interest (e.g. KOI and TOI catalogs) tables available in archives/respositories such as
  [NExSci](https://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu/),
  [ExoFOP](https://exofop.ipac.caltech.edu/), [TEV](https://tev.mit.edu/data/) and
  [MAST](https://archive.stsci.edu/);
- Light curve and target pixel FITS files and other data products generated by the TESS Science Processing Operations 
- Center (SPOC) pipeline available in archives such as the [MAST](https://archive.stsci.edu/).

- We would like to thank multiple people who directly or indirectly contributed to this work. This work includes data 
collected by the TESS mission and obtained from the MAST data archive at the Space Telescope Science Institute 
(STScI). Funding for the TESS mission was provided by the NASA Science Mission Directorate. Resources supporting 
this work were provided by the NASA High-End Computing (HEC) Program through the NASA Advanced Supercomputing (NAS) 
Division at Ames Research Center for the production of the TESS SOC data products and for training our deep learning

Funding for the TESS mission is provided by NASA's Science Mission Directorate. We acknowledge support from the TESS 
mission via subaward s3449 from MIT. This work makes use of observations from the LCOGT network. Part of the LCOGT 
telescope time was granted by NOIRLab through the Mid-Scale Innovations Program (MSIP). MSIP is funded by NSF. This 
work is based on observations made with the Las Cumbres Observatory’s education network telescopes that were upgraded 
through generous support from the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation. This work is based on observations made with the 
MuSCAT3/4 instruments, developed by the Astrobiology Center (ABC) in Japan, the University of Tokyo, and Las Cumbres 
Observatory (LCOGT). MuSCAT3 was developed with financial support by JSPS KAKENHI (JP18H05439) and JST PRESTO
